You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\\n\\nsection: General course-related questions\\nquestion: Course - Can I follow the course after it finishes?\\nanswer: Yes, we will keep all the materials after the course finishes, so you can follow the course at your own pace after it finishes.\\nYou can also continue looking at the homeworks and continue preparing for the next cohort.

      "Patching KDE on FreeBSD is a multi-step process that involves cloning the KDE Git repository, updating the repository with patches, configuring and building KDE, and setting up the desktop environment. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Prerequisites:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Install the ports or packages required for building KDE, including `ports-mgmt/pkg` for package management, `devel/gmake`, `lang/perl5`, `devel/gdbm`, `devel/boost-libs`, and `x11-toolkits/qt5-kdetoools` (for Qt5).\n",
      "2. You need a Qt5 base, which might be installed from ports or packages, and you'll need the version that matches the one in the port of kde4. \n",
      "3. Update your `ports` or package database.\n",
      "4. Ensure that you have a working X11 server (e.g., `xfree86`).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Clone the KDE Git repository\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "# Clone the KDE Git repository\n",
      "git clone https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kde.git kde-source\n",
      "cd kde-source\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Update the repository with FreeBSD patches\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "# Create a branch for your patches\n",
      "git checkout -b freebsd-branch\n",
      "\n",
      "# Update the repository with FreeBSD patches\n",
      "svn co svn://svn.kde.org/home/kde/frameworks/revisions\n",
      "patch -p 1 < ~/kde-revisions/<your_patch_here>\n",
      "\n",
      "# You also may need to update the kdelibs port\n",
      "svn co svn://svn.kde.org/home/kde/kdelibs/revisions\n",
      "patch -p 1 < ~/kdelibs-revision/<your_patch_here>\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Configure and build KDE\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "# Build Qt5 base\n",
      "mkdir -p kde-source/src/Qt5/build\n",
      "cd kde-source/src/Qt5/build\n",
      "qmake\n",
      "make package\n",
      "\n",
      "# Change to your build directory\n",
      "mkdir -p kde-source/build/base\n",
      "cd kde-source/build/base\n",
      "\n",
      "# Configure and build kde\n",
      "gmake clean\n",
      "./kbuildsycoca5\n",
      "./configure \\\n",
      "  --prefix=/usr/local \\\n",
      "  --enable-threaded-decission \\\n",
      "  --with-qt5 \\\n",
      "  --build-verbose \\\n",
      "  --build-tests \\\n",
      "  --build-examples \\\n",
      "  CXX=`which c++` \\\n",
      "  CFLAGS=\"-O2\" \\\n",
      "  CXXFLAGS=\"-O2\" \\\n",
      "  -v\n",
      "gmake\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Install KDE\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "gmake install \\\n",
      "  KDEDIR=${prefix} \\\n",
      "  KDEDIRS=${prefix}:/kde \\\n",
      "  KDEHOME=.\\%HOME% \\\n",
      "  KDE_USER_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/kde4 \\\n",
      "  KDE_DISTCC=no \\\n",
      "  KDE_BUILD=.\\%BASE%\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Set up the desktop environment\n",
      "\n",
      "1. After installation, you need to link some important libraries and executables.\n",
      "2. Then, create `~/.config/kdeglobals` with the desired settings (e.g., for the default desktop background).\n",
      "3. Set up your KDE desktop by creating `~/.kde/shutdown.sh`, `~/.kde/login.sh`, and `~/.kde/desktop.sh` files.\n",
      "4. You can also create `~/.kde/env/kde-settings.sh` with the environment variables or desktop settings you might want. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Notes\n",
      "\n",
      "1. You can also use the binary packages available from the official repositories to install KDE4. The packages are available in the `graphics/kde4-base`, `graphics/kde4`, `graphics/kde4-dcop`, `graphics/kde4-phonon`, `graphics/kde4-plasma`, `graphics/kde4-libs`, `graphics/kde4-webkit`, `graphics/kde4-filesystem`, and other related packages. However, this is not supported by the KDE developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. It is highly recommended that you build Qt5 from source using its own source code (available on the Qt website, in the Qt5 repository) in order to have a version that is known to be working under FreeBSD.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. You may need to add additional packages for certain KDE applications, such as `x11-fonts/fontconfig`, `x11-fonts/freetype2`, `x11-fonts/pil`, and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that the process outlined above is a general guide and might require some additional steps depending on your system configuration.\n"

      "answer: You need to look for the Py4J file and note the version of the filename. Once you know the version, you can update the export command accordingly, this is how you check yours:\n",
      "` ls ${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/ ` and then you add it in the export command, mine was:\n",
      "export PYTHONPATH=”${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/Py4J-0.10.9.5-src.zip:${PYTHONPATH}”\n",
      "Make sure that the version under `${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/` matches the filename of py4j or you will encounter `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'py4j'` while executing `import pyspark`.\n",
      "For instance, if the file under `${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/` was `py4j-0.10.9.3-src.zip`.\n",
      "Then the export PYTHONPATH statement above should be changed to `export PYTHONPATH=\"${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9.3-src.zip:$PYTHONPATH\"` appropriately.\n",
      "Additionally, you can check for the version of ‘py4j’ of the spark you’re using from here and update as mentioned above.\n",
      "~ Abhijit Chakraborty: Sometimes, even with adding the correct version of py4j might not solve the problem. Simply run pip install py4j and problem should be resolved.\n",
